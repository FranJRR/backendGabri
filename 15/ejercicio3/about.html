                <p>That's a great idea. I'd love to park. No. What? I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
                    About
                    how far ahead are you going?

                    Doc. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer
                    Parker called you twice. Oh. Watch this. Not me, the car, the car. My calculations are correct, when
                    this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, your gonna see some serious shit. Watch this, watch
                    this.
                    Ha, what did I tell you, eighty-eight miles per hour. The temporal displacement occurred at exactly
                    1:20
                    a.m. and zero seconds. Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads.

                    Leave me alone. We do now. I have a feeling too. Yeah, sure, okay. We all make mistakes in life,
                    children
